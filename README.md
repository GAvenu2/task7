# task7:- Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
Malicious browser extensions can seriously harm users by abusing the powerful permissions they receive. They can steal data such as browsing history, personal information, or session tokens, leading to privacy loss and account compromise. Extensions may also cause browser redirection, sending users to phishing sites or unsafe search engines. Many perform ad injection, adding unwanted ads, pop-ups, and scripts that slow the browser and expose users to scams. The most severe threat is credential harvesting, where extensions capture usernames, passwords, or login tokens, allowing attackers to take over accounts. Regular extension reviews and cautious installation help reduce these risks.
